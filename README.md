# CAR-SALES-FULL-PROJECT


## Linear Regression Analysis Report

### Data Preprocessing:
The data contains car sales information with various attributes like manufacturer, model, sales figures, vehicle type, price, engine size, fuel capacity, and fuel efficiency. After handling missing values, the dataset had no missing values for manufacturer or vehicle type.

Linear Regression Scenario 1 (Fuel Efficiency):
A regression model was built to predict fuel efficiency based on various factors. The model showed no missing data for manufacturer or fuel efficiency. 

For example, when predicting fuel efficiency for a specific set of vehicles, the model found no missing data for fuel efficiency.

Linear Regression Scenario 2 (Price):
A regression model was created to predict vehicle prices based on manufacturer and fuel capacity. For a certain set of vehicles, no missing data was found for manufacturer or fuel capacity.

## Summary:
- This linear regression analysis aimed to model vehicle fuel efficiency and pricing based on relevant attributes like manufacturer, vehicle type, fuel capacity, etc.
- After preprocessing, no missing data was found for variables like manufacturer, vehicle type, or fuel efficiency/capacity.
- The specific values for fuel efficiency and pricing varied based on the vehicle set being analyzed.

Overall, the data preprocessing step focused on handling missing data for attributes like manufacturer, vehicle type, fuel efficiency, and fuel capacity. The model was able to analyze fuel efficiency and pricing for certain vehicle sets without missing data issues.
