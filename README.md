## CAR-SALES-FULL-PROJECT


This project aims to analyze car sales data using Python for data preprocessing and linear regression modeling, as well as SQL for exploratory data analysis. The project also includes visualizations created with Tableau to better understand and communicate the insights derived from the data.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various car models, including their sales figures, prices, engine specifications, fuel efficiency, and other relevant details. The dataset is not included in this repository due to potential copyright issues, but you can obtain it from Kaggle.
Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

python_code/: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, linear regression modeling, and other analysis tasks.
sql_code/: Contains SQL scripts for exploratory data analysis and data manipulation.
tableau_visualizations/: Contains the Tableau workbook file and any supporting files for the visualizations.

### Requirements
To run the Python scripts, you'll need to have the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

You'll also need a MySQL server installed to run the SQL scripts.

### Visualizations
The Tableau visualizations in this project provide insights into various aspects of the car sales data, including:
Price vs Resale Value
Best Selling Models
Average Sales per Month
Average Sales per Year
Fuel Efficiency vs Capacity
and More!

### Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
